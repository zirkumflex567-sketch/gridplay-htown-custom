## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Requirements
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **JavaScript enabled**
- **Internet connection** (for streaming videos)

### Architecture
- **Static web application** - no server required
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - no dependencies
- **HTML5 video APIs** - native browser support
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - responsive layouts

## Deployment Workflow (htown)

The customized production deployment uses a dedicated GitHub repo and a polling auto-deploy timer on htown.

- Source of truth: the customized GridPlay GitHub repository
- Deployment target: static app under nginx `/gridplay` and API under `/gridplay-api`
- Automation: a systemd `oneshot` service triggered by a systemd timer every minute

Recommended operational flow:

1. Push updates to `main` in the customized repo.
2. htown timer runs deploy script and pulls latest commit.
3. Script syncs static files and API code, then restarts/reloads required services.
4. Script runs lightweight validation (service status + health checks) and logs output via `journalctl`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Saving Configurations
Configurations are saved as JSON files containing:
```json
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "id": "video-1",
      "src": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...",
      "name": "Video Title"
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T14:35:22.000Z",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### Grid Layouts
GridPlay automatically chooses the optimal layout:
- **1 video**: Full screen
- **2 videos**: Side by side
- **3 videos**: Triangular arrangement
- **4 videos**: 2×2 grid
- **6 videos**: 3×2 grid
- **9+ videos**: 3×3 grid

## 🔧 Customization

### Modifying the Interface
The entire application is contained in a single HTML file. You can customize:
- **Colors and styling** in the `<style>` section
- **Grid layouts** by modifying the CSS grid classes
- **Supported platforms** by editing the URL detection functions

### Adding New Video Platforms
To add support for new video platforms:

1. **Add URL detection** in the `addVideo()` function
2. **Create conversion function** (like `convertYouTubeUrl()`)
3. **Add embed template** in the video element creation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video Won't Load
- **Check URL format** - ensure it's a direct video link or supported platform
- **Embedding restrictions** - some videos block embedding (will show fallback link)
- **CORS issues** - some direct URLs may not work due to server restrictions

### Drag & Drop Not Working
- **Browser security** - ensure you're not dragging from HTTPS to HTTP
- **File permissions** - check if browser has access to local files
- **Clear browser cache** - refresh the page and try again

### Performance Issues
- **Too many videos** - limit to 9 videos for optimal performance
- **Large file sizes** - compress videos for better streaming
- **Browser memory** - close other tabs if experiencing lag
